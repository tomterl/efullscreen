;;; Commentary:
;; Generalized automatic execution in a single frame
;;
;; This is a library that package developers can use to provide user
;; friendly single window per frame execution of buffer exposing
;; commands, as well as to use in personal emacs configurations to attain
;; the same goal for packages that don't use =fullframe= or the likes of
;; it themself.
;;
;;  Example: Setup =magit-status= to open in one window in the current
;;  frame when called
;; Example:
;; - Open magit-status in a single window in fullscreen
;;   (require 'fullframe)
;;   (fullframe magit-status magit-mode-quit-window :magit-fullscreen nil)
;;
